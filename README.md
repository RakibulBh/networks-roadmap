# 📡 Computer Networks Learning Journey 🚀

This repository documents my **15-day roadmap** to mastering key computer networking concepts in preparation for my assignment. It includes a checklist of tasks, mini-projects, and systematic learning strategies to ensure both clarity and progress tracking.

---

## 📌 **Assignment Focus Areas**

- 🌐 Setting up a test network with a specific topology
- 🔄 Understanding and documenting client-server protocols
- 🛠️ Network troubleshooting and analysis
- 📝 Writing a comprehensive technical report

## 🗺️ **Roadmap: 15 Days to Networking Proficiency**

### **Days 1–3: Building the Foundation**

Networks are like a postal system. Start with understanding the basics:

- ✅ **IP Addressing** (like understanding house addresses)
- ✅ **Subnets** (neighborhoods in the postal analogy)
- ✅ **TCP/UDP Protocols** (rules for sending mail)
- ✅ **Client-Server Architecture** (a restaurant with waiters and a kitchen)

**Practical Project:**  
Develop a **simple chat application** using Python's socket programming. This hands-on project brings foundational concepts to life.

---

### **Days 4–6: Mastering Network Tools**

Gain practical skills with essential network analysis tools:

- ☐ **Wireshark** (X-ray vision for network traffic)
- ☐ **Linux Commands** (e.g., `ifconfig`, `ipconfig`)
- ☐ **Netstat** (monitor active connections)
- ☐ **Ping** (test connections and latency)

**Practical Project:**  
Set up **two virtual machines**, capture their communication with Wireshark, and analyze the results.

---

### **Days 7–9: Virtual Network Setup**

Recreate your assignment’s required network topology:

- ☐ **Virtual Machine Setup**
- ☐ **DHCP Configuration**
- ☐ **Router Setup**
- ☐ **Subnet Configuration**

**Practical Project:**  
Document the entire topology setup with screenshots and explanations for future reference.

---

### **Days 10–11: Protocol Analysis**

Dive deeper into client-server communication protocols:

- ☐ Understand **TCP/IP Protocol Analysis**
- ☐ Master **Client-Server Message Formatting**
- ☐ Learn **Protocol Documentation Techniques**

**Practical Project:**  
Simulate a **cafe order processing system** (similar to your assignment) to grasp expected behavior.

---

### **Days 12–13: Debugging Networks**

Develop systematic approaches to solve network issues:

- ☐ Fix **Network Connectivity Issues**
- ☐ Resolve **Protocol Mismatches**
- ☐ Debug **Client-Server Communication Problems**

**Practical Project:**  
Introduce intentional errors in your setup and resolve them, documenting every troubleshooting step.

---

### **Days 14–15: Final Touches**

Polish your work and prepare your submission:

- ☐ Write a **Technical Report** with evidence
- ☐ Compile **Screenshots and Logs**
- ☐ Conduct **Final Testing and Validation**

---

## 🔧 **Learning Workflow for Each Concept**

1. 📺 **Watch a video tutorial** for an overview (YouTube is your friend!)
2. 📖 **Read official documentation** for deeper understanding.
3. 🧑‍💻 **Complete a hands-on mini-project** to apply the knowledge.
4. 🎓 **Teach the concept** (to a peer or even to yourself).
